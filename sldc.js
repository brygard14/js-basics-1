// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
*/

const step1 = 'Planning: The phase in which developers will plan for the upcoming project. This includes defining the problem and scope of any existing systems as well as determine the objectives for thier new systems. During this phase, devs can help catch problems before they affect development, secure funding and resources needed to make their plan happen, and set a project schedule.'

const step2 = 'Analysis of Requirements: The phase in which developers may define any prototype system requirements, evaluate alternatives to existing prototypes, perform research and analysis to determine the needs of end-users, and create an SRS (software requirement specification) document.'

const step3 = 'Design: The phase in which developers will first outline the details of the overall application, alongside specific aspects, such as its user interfaces, system interfaces, network and network requirements, and databases. They may turn the SRS document into a more logical structure to later be implemented in a programming language. Operation, training, and maintenance plans will be drawn up.'

const step4 = 'Implementation: The phase in which developers will follow the plan they have put together and handle problems that come up. They will focus on development and implementation of computer software code routines to produce each project deliverable.'

const step5 = 'Testing & Integration: The phase in which developers go over their software to note any bus or defects that need to be tracked, fixed, and later retested to meet the quality standards that were previously defined in the SRS document. Then, the system will be integrated into its environment and installed.'

const step6 = 'Maintain: The phase in which developers may begin practicing any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users and implement any changes that the software might need after deployment. '
